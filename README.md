# Debugify
The open source iOS 13 Internal Settings installer. The AppleInternal is purged on non checkra1n devices and therefore should not be used on such devices. I am not a product of Apple and all legal rights are to be treated to Apple. I am not responsible for files being disrupted or destroyed with the use of these tools while they shouldn't cause harm the way you use them is dependent on yourself.

**STAY AWAY FROM INTERNALPWN's VERSION OF DEBUGIFY. THEY STEAL IDEAS AND CALL IT THEIR OWN.**

**PLEASE NOTE THIS ONLY WORKS ON 13.X DEVICES**
*I have only tested this on the 6,6s,7,7P,8,8P,X*

**Download from here**

*Due to a bug in NewTerm the app may crash when running the script for whatever reason. So if that happens to you I recommend using SSH over a computer or another mobile device. Thanks*

## How to run.
Open NewTerm or a SSH client to login to your phone. Make sure your set as root while SSH users should already be root in the case that you are using NewTerm and aren't root run "su" on NewTerm. Now navigate to the directory of the script and run "chmod +x debugify.sh" after run the final command to start the installation "./debugify.sh"

**SystemVersion.plist no longer needs to be edited as of v2.1 therefore the instruction has been removed!**

Profit.
